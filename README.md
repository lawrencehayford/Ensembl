# Getting started

## Installation of laravel on Windows
Laravel utilizes Composer to manage its dependencies. So, before using Laravel, make sure you have Composer installed on your machine.

Download composer from https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe

After installing composer, open your terminal and run

    composer global require "laravel/installer"

## Running application

Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/lawrencehayford/Ensembl.git

Switch to the repo folder

    cd Ensembl

Run application using this command

    php artisan serve

Browse http://127.0.0.1:8000 to view application

# Strategies For Testing This App

## In Development Stage

In development stage, laravel already has phpunit component installed and we write these test in tests/Feature

To run these test in development mode run the following command

    php vendor/phpunit/phpunit/phpunit

Or if php unit is set in the environmental viariables Run

    phpunit

Running this line of code will show if tests were passed or failed    

## In Production Stage

In Production mode, we can run these tests automatically.
Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD eg Genkins) will take the code when we push it to a version control system ( â†’ e.g Git) and it will execute all our tests in a pre-defined build environment to make sure everything is working as expected, not only on the development machine but also in a clear production-alike environment.


## A Test Example I wrote in my application

This test calls the the clean class in my app/EnsemblClasses/Clean.php and executes the ValidateRequest($inputs) function.

The ValidateRequest function checks if the inputs passed to the php server side to send a curl request has post['url'] and post['method']. if the system checks that any of these two Post key name (url and method) is not avialable, it will return false and when my test runs, it will return false because it failed

## Sample of my test class

  ```
        namespace Tests\Feature;

        use Tests\TestCase;
        use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\WithFaker;
        use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;
        use App\EnsemblClasses\Clean;

        class CouponTest extends TestCase
        {
            /**
             * test creating coupons
             *
             * @return void
             */
             private $Clean;
             private $input;

            public function testRequestvalidation()
            {
                //checking if data coming has post[url] and post[method]
                $this->input=array( 'url' => "http://rest.ensembl.org/lookup/symbol/homo_sapiens/BRCA2.json?;expand=1",
                                    'method' => "GET"
                                 );
                $this->Clean = new Clean();
                $this->assertTrue($this->Clean->ValidateRequest($this->input));

            }
        }

      ```
